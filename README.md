# Alumni-Network
This network is designed to help alumni stay connected after graduation. 

# Alumni Career Community

## Why

2020 was an eventful year. I graduated from UCSD in the mist of Covid-19. To keep my career growing and continue my learning, I constructed this project as a way to help my alumni network stay in touch using a few of the skills I learned this past year. 


## What

The gist of this project is to build an alumni career development community, that connects alumni across different companies and industries. The services, after they are built, are intented to help alumni connect with a community (insert employee, email, etc), search the directory by employee, company, or industry and connect with each other.

The envisioned alumni career community is online.  Alumni registers with the community app portal.  After the registration alumni can search by industry, by company, by school or year.  Alumi can poke and connect.  Community activities happen off the portal with preferred channel such as SLACK, Microsoft Team, meetup etc.  
The app portal is deployed to public cloud.  It is maintained by site admin.  A simple FAQ bot is setup to handle the routine questions.
