# Alumni Career Community

## Why
(Explains why, when and how this idea.  This is optional)

Year 2020 is a magical year.  I graduated from UCSD ...in the mist of Covid. To keep growing career and learning,  I constructed this project and keeps working on it during spare time.  


## What
(Explains what it does)
The gist of this project is to build an alumni career development community, that connects alumni across industries. The services, after it's built, are for alumni's to join the community (insert employee, email, etc), search the alumni by industry, or by employer) and connect.

The envisioned alumni career community is online.  Alumni registers with the community app portal.  After the registration alumni can search by industry, by company, by school or year.  Alumi can poke and connect.  Community activities happen off the portal with preferred channel such as SLACK, Microsoft Team, meetup etc.  
The app portal is deployed to public cloud.  It is maintained by site admin.  A simple FAQ bot is setup to handle the routine questions.
